JS Calculator
=================

Ver. 2.0.0

A Calculator made in javascript. I created this mainly just to experience the process of implementing and publishing
a live web page. A version of this code is actually in production at www.jscalculator.com. The current version only
supports decimal math.

Future Features/Changes:
- Hexadecimal math and conversions
- Binary math and conversions
- Responsive UI/Mobile site

To do list:
- Implement change base mode features
    + Add a flag that won't allow changing the base mode once input has been entered
- Look up how to write test cases, and practice writing them for this program and doing unit tests.
